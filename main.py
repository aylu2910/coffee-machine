    print("What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):")

#todo: 1. Prompt user by asking “What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):​”
#todo: a.  Check the user’s input to decide what to do next.
#todo: b.  The prompt should show every time action has completed, e.g. once the drink is dispensed. The prompt should show again to serve the next customer.
#todo: 2.  Turn off the Coffee Machine by entering “off​” to the prompt.
#todo: a.  For maintainers of the coffee machine, they can use “off” as the secret word to turn off the machine. Your code should end execution when this happens.
#todo: 3.  Print report.
#todo: a.  When the user enters “report” to the prompt, a report should be generated that shows the current resource values. e.g.
#todo: Water: 100ml 
#todo: Milk: 50ml 
#todo: Coffee: 76g 
#todo: Money: $2.5 
#todo: 4.  Check resources sufficient?
#todo: a.  When the user chooses a drink, the program should check if there are enough resources to make that drink.
#todo: b.  E.g. if Latte requires 200ml water but there is only 100ml left in the machine. It should not continue to make the drink but print: “Sorry there is not enough water.​”
#todo: c.   The same should happen if another resource is depleted, e.g. milk or coffee.
#todo: 5.  Process coins.
#todo: a.  If there are sufficient resources to make the drink selected, then the program should prompt the user to insert coins.
#todo: b.  Remember that quarters = $0.25, dimes = $0.10, nickles = $0.05, pennies = $0.01
#todo: c.   Calculate the monetary value of the coins inserted. E.g. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 2
#todo: pennies = 0.25 + 0.1 x 2 + 0.05 + 0.01 x 2 = $0.52
#todo: 6.  Check transaction successful?
